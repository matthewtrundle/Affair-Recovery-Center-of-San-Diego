### ‚ùå NON-COMPLIANT: Problem Section ("It Hurts More Than You Can Put Into Words")

**Master Copy Content**:
> One day you thought your life was steady‚Äîthe next, everything collapsed.
>
> You replay moments, search for answers, and wonder if you'll ever feel normal again. Shame creeps in: Why am I still here? Why can't I stop asking questions?
>
> And your partner? They're trapped in their own shame, unsure how to repair the damage or respond without making it worse.

**Current Implementation** (ProblemPromiseSection.tsx):
> I understand the pain you're experiencing.
>
> Whether you've just discovered the betrayal or you're months into processing this trauma, you're likely experiencing a whirlwind of emotions. The life you built together in San Diego ‚Äî from weekend trips to La Jolla Cove to quiet evenings in Balboa Park ‚Äî suddenly feels shattered.
>
> The hypervigilance, intrusive thoughts, and waves of grief you're experiencing are normal trauma responses...

### ‚ùå NON-COMPLIANT: FAQ Preview

2. **Should I ask every detail about the affair?** ‚Äì No. Reliving graphic details only adds pain. What helps is understanding why it happened and how your partner will ensure it doesn't happen again.
3. **Can trust really be rebuilt?** ‚Äì Yes. It feels impossible now, but with honesty, patience, and guided support, many couples rebuild‚Äîand even grow stronger.
