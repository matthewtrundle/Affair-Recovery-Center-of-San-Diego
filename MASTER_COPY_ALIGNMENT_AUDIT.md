## Key Learnings

### Brand Voice Requirements
The master copy uses:
- **Direct, trauma-aware language** (not clinical jargon)
- **Emotional resonance** ("One day you thought your life was steady—the next, everything collapsed")
- **San Diego specificity** (neighborhoods, landmarks)
- **Client-first perspective** (starts with their pain, not therapist credentials)
- **Accessible terminology** (avoids "complexities," "cutting-edge," "expertise")

### HTML Entity Requirements
When updating copy, use HTML entities for special characters:
- `&apos;` for apostrophes
- `&mdash;` for em dashes
- `&quot;` for quotes

This prevents build errors in Next.js/JSX.
