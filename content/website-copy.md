### The Reality You're Facing

If you're reading this, your world has likely been turned upside down. Whether you discovered the affair yesterday or months ago, you're probably experiencing a storm of emotions that feel overwhelming and contradictory.

**For the betrayed partner:** The person you trusted most has broken that sacred bond. You're cycling between rage and numbness, love and disgust. You can't stop the mental movies. Sleep feels impossible. You wonder if you'll ever feel safe again.

**For the unfaithful partner:** You're drowning in shame and confusion. You want to fix this, but everything you say seems to make it worse. You're terrified of losing everything, yet you know you've caused immeasurable pain. You wonder if forgiveness is even possible.

**Here's what you need to know:** These reactions are normal. You're not going crazy. You're responding to a profound relational trauma, and your nervous system is doing exactly what it's designed to do in the face of threat.

---

### A Different Kind of Help

My name is Jordan Zipkin, and for over 15 years, I've specialized in guiding couples through the specific challenges of affair recovery. This isn't general couples therapy—it's a structured, research-backed approach designed specifically for betrayal trauma.

**My approach combines:**
- **Gottman Method:** Proven protocols for rebuilding trust after infidelity
- **Relational Life Therapy (RLT):** Direct, compassionate techniques that create real change
- **Neuroscience Education:** Understanding how trauma affects your brain and body

You don't need to know if your relationship will survive. You just need to take the next right step.

**Schedule Your Consultation**

### The Path Forward: Three Phases of Healing

#### Phase 1: Stabilize (Weeks 1-4)
First, we create safety. We'll establish boundaries, manage the crisis, and help you both regulate your nervous systems. You'll learn how to have difficult conversations without causing more damage.

#### Phase 2: Structure (Weeks 5-12)
Next, we build a framework for recovery. Through structured exercises and guided discussions, we'll process the betrayal, understand contributing factors (without excusing them), and begin addressing underlying relationship patterns.

#### Phase 3: Rebuild (Weeks 13-20+)
Finally, we focus on creating your new relationship. This isn't about going back—it's about moving forward into something stronger and more authentic than before.

**"Is recovery really possible?"**
Yes. While not every relationship survives an affair, many emerge stronger. Recovery is absolutely possible when both partners are willing to do the work.

**"How long will this take?"**
Most couples need 12-20 sessions to move through the acute phase of recovery. Full healing typically takes 1-2 years, but you'll see progress much sooner.

**"What if we're not sure about staying together?"**
That's completely normal. You don't need to make that decision now. Therapy will help you gain clarity.

## SERVICES - BETRAYAL RECOVERY

### Specialized Therapy for Affair Recovery

When trust has been shattered by infidelity, you need more than general couples counseling. You need a therapist who understands the unique dynamics of betrayal trauma and has a proven roadmap for healing.

---

### Who This Is For

**This specialized therapy helps couples who are dealing with:**
- Recent discovery of an affair (emotional, physical, or both)
- Long-term infidelity that has finally come to light
- Multiple betrayals or repeated broken promises
- Online affairs, pornography addiction, or digital infidelity
- Workplace affairs or inappropriate relationships
- The aftermath of disclosure or discovery

**Both partners must be willing to:**
- Attend sessions consistently
- Be honest, even when it's difficult
- Consider the possibility of healing
- Take responsibility for their own growth

You don't need to know if you want to stay together. You just need to be willing to explore what's possible.

---

### What Sessions Look Like

**Structure and Safety**
Each 50-minute session follows a structured format designed to maximize safety and progress. We begin with a brief check-in, move into focused work on specific recovery tasks, and end with homework that builds on our session.

**Active Participation**
This isn't passive talk therapy. You'll engage in structured exercises, practice new communication skills, and work through guided protocols proven to facilitate healing.

**Individual Support When Needed**
Sometimes, one or both partners need individual sessions to process trauma, manage emotions, or address personal issues affecting recovery. We'll determine this together based on your unique situation.

**Between-Session Work**
Recovery happens both in and out of sessions. You'll receive specific homework assignments—from communication exercises to trust-building activities—tailored to your phase of healing.

## APPROACH PAGE

### The Gottman Method + Relational Life Therapy: A Powerful Combination for Affair Recovery

Healing from infidelity requires more than good intentions. It requires proven methods, skilled guidance, and a willingness to do things differently. My approach combines two of the most effective therapeutic frameworks for affair recovery.

---

### The Gottman Method for Affair Recovery

Developed by Drs. John and Julie Gottman through 40+ years of research, this method provides a clear, three-phase approach to healing from infidelity.

**What Makes Gottman Different:**
The Gottman Method isn't based on theory—it's based on observing what actually works. Through decades of research with thousands of couples, the Gottmans identified specific behaviors that predict relationship success or failure.

**Key Components for Betrayal Recovery:**

**Atone Phase:** The unfaithful partner takes full responsibility, ends the affair completely, and demonstrates genuine empathy for the pain caused. We establish boundaries, manage triggers, and create safety.

**Attune Phase:** Both partners work to understand how the affair happened (without excusing it). We explore relationship vulnerabilities, individual wounds, and patterns that need addressing.

**Attach Phase:** Together, you'll rebuild your emotional and physical connection. This includes creating new rituals, rebuilding intimacy, and establishing a shared vision for your future.

**Practical Tools You'll Learn:**
- The "Trust Revival Method" for systematic trust rebuilding
- "Emotion Coaching" to navigate intense feelings
- "Repair Conversations" that actually resolve conflict
- "Love Maps" to deepen understanding and connection

---

### Relational Life Therapy (RLT): Direct and Transformative

Created by Terry Real, RLT brings a refreshingly direct approach that creates rapid, lasting change. Where traditional therapy can sometimes feel passive, RLT actively challenges destructive patterns.

**Core RLT Principles:**

**Radical Accountability:** Both partners take 100% responsibility for their own behavior, regardless of what their partner does. This isn't about blame—it's about empowerment.

**Intimacy as a Skill:** True intimacy isn't something you fall into—it's something you build through specific, learnable skills. We'll teach you how to be truly vulnerable and present.

**Grandiosity and Shame:** Most relationship problems stem from swinging between feeling "better than" (grandiose) or "less than" (shame). RLT helps you find the healthy middle ground of "same as"—human, imperfect, and worthy of love.

**Speaking the Unspeakable:** RLT creates space to say what really needs to be said, with skill and compassion. No more walking on eggshells or avoiding the real issues.

**What This Looks Like in Practice:**
- Direct feedback that cuts through denial and defensiveness
- Role-playing new ways of responding to old triggers
- Challenging victim/villain narratives that keep you stuck
- Building "relational heroism"—choosing love over being right

---

### The Neuroscience of Betrayal and Healing

Understanding your brain's response to betrayal isn't just interesting—it's essential for healing. When you understand the biology of trauma and attachment, everything starts to make more sense.

**Your Brain on Betrayal:**

**The Trauma Response:** Discovery of an affair triggers the same brain regions as physical danger. Your amygdala (alarm system) goes into overdrive while your prefrontal cortex (reasoning center) goes offline. This is why you can't "just get over it" or "think your way through" the early stages.

**Attachment Disruption:** Infidelity ruptures your attachment bond, triggering primal abandonment fears. Your nervous system becomes dysregulated, swinging between hypervigilance (anxious attachment) and numbness (avoidant attachment).

**The Path to Healing:** Through specific interventions, we can calm your nervous system, rewire trauma responses, and rebuild secure attachment. This isn't just talk—it's biological change.

**Brain-Based Techniques We'll Use:**
- Bilateral stimulation to process traumatic memories
- Breathwork and grounding for emotional regulation
- Mindfulness practices to strengthen your prefrontal cortex
- Attachment exercises to rebuild neural pathways of trust

---

### Why This Combination Works

**Comprehensive Healing**
Gottman provides the roadmap, RLT provides the engine, and neuroscience explains the journey. Together, they address every aspect of recovery—emotional, relational, and physiological.

**Proven Results**
Both methods are extensively researched and proven effective for affair recovery. When combined with trauma-informed neuroscience, success rates increase significantly.

**Practical and Deep**
You'll get both immediate tools for crisis management and deep work for lasting transformation. This isn't just about surviving the affair—it's about creating a relationship better than before.

**Hope Grounded in Science**
This isn't wishful thinking or empty promises. It's a systematic, evidence-based approach that has helped thousands of couples not just heal, but thrive.

**Ready to Begin?**

You don't need to understand everything about these approaches to start. You just need to be willing to try something different.

### A Personal Commitment to Professional Excellence

For over 15 years, I've dedicated my practice to helping couples navigate one of life's most devastating challenges: betrayal. This specialization isn't just professional—it's a calling born from witnessing the profound transformation possible when couples have the right support.

Early in my career, I noticed that general couples therapy often fell short when addressing infidelity. The stakes were higher, the emotions more intense, and the path forward less clear. I committed to becoming the therapist I wished existed for these couples—someone with specialized training, proven methods, and unwavering hope grounded in experience.

### My Philosophy on Healing

I believe that every relationship crisis contains the seeds of transformation. This doesn't minimize the pain of betrayal—it honors it. When we have the courage to face our deepest wounds and most difficult truths, we create the possibility for profound growth.

**What I Know to Be True:**

**Pain is the Path:** We can't heal what we won't feel. Recovery requires moving through the pain, not around it. I'll be your guide through this difficult terrain.

**Both Partners Are Hurting:** While betrayal creates a clear "injured party," both partners are usually carrying wounds that need attention. Compassion for all involved creates the conditions for healing.

**Change Is Possible:** I've seen hundreds of couples transform their relationships after infidelity. Not all choose to stay together, but all can heal and grow from the experience.

**You're Stronger Than You Know:** Right now, you might feel broken beyond repair. But humans are remarkably resilient, and relationships can be incredibly redemptive when given the chance.

---

### Why I Specialize in Betrayal Recovery

Too many couples affected by infidelity receive well-meaning but inadequate help. General therapy techniques often retraumatize the betrayed partner or let the unfaithful partner off the hook. Both scenarios prevent real healing.

Betrayal recovery requires specific protocols, specialized knowledge, and a therapist who won't be overwhelmed by the intensity of the work. After years of advanced training and clinical experience, I can hold space for your pain while guiding you toward healing with confidence and clarity.

Every couple deserves a therapist who:
- Understands the neurobiology of betrayal trauma
- Has proven protocols for rebuilding trust
- Won't judge or take sides
- Maintains hope without minimizing reality
- Knows when to be gentle and when to be direct

This is what I offer. Not because I'm perfect or have all the answers, but because I've dedicated my career to becoming the specialist these situations demand.

---

### Outside the Office

I believe therapists should be real people, not blank slates. When I'm not in the office, you'll find me hiking the trails of Torrey Pines, attempting to surf at La Jolla Shores, or exploring San Diego's incredible food scene with my family.

These activities aren't just hobbies—they're how I maintain the emotional resilience necessary for this intense work. Self-care isn't selfish; it's what allows me to show up fully present for my clients.

---

If you're looking for a therapist who combines professional expertise with genuine compassion, who won't shy away from hard truths but will deliver them with care, I'd be honored to support your journey.

### Frequently Asked Questions About Scheduling

**"Should we come together or separately for the first session?"**
For affair recovery, I typically recommend coming together for the first session, with individual sessions scheduled soon after. We'll determine the best approach during your consultation.

**"How often will we need to come?"**
Weekly sessions are essential during the acute recovery phase (first 3-4 months). We can discuss spacing sessions further apart as you stabilize and progress.

**"What if my partner isn't ready for therapy?"**
Individual therapy can be valuable even if your partner isn't ready. We can discuss options during your consultation.

**"Can we do intensive sessions?"**
Yes. Some couples benefit from 2-3 hour intensive sessions or full-day workshops. These can accelerate progress when time is limited.

**Ready to Begin Your Healing Journey?**

The hardest part is reaching out. Once you've scheduled, you've already taken the most important step.

## FAQ PAGE

### Frequently Asked Questions

---

### About Recovery

**"Can we really recover from this?"**

Yes, recovery is possible—but it's not guaranteed. Success depends on several factors: the unfaithful partner's willingness to take full accountability, the betrayed partner's eventual willingness to consider rebuilding, and both partners' commitment to the process.

Research shows that couples who actively engage in specialized therapy have a 70% chance of staying together, with most reporting their relationship becomes stronger than before. Even couples who ultimately separate report that therapy helped them heal individually and separate with less damage.

Recovery doesn't mean forgetting or going back to how things were. It means creating something new, with deeper understanding and stronger foundations.

---

**"How long does healing take?"**

The acute phase typically lasts 3-6 months, where emotions are most intense and unpredictable. Most couples need 12-20 therapy sessions to work through the initial trauma and establish a recovery foundation.

Full healing usually takes 1-2 years, though you'll see meaningful progress much sooner. Factors that influence timeline include:
- How long the affair lasted
- Whether it was emotional, physical, or both
- If this is a repeated betrayal
- The level of deception involved
- Both partners' commitment to healing
- Previous trauma history

Remember: healing isn't linear. You'll have good days and setbacks. This is normal and doesn't mean you're not progressing.

---

**"What if only one of us wants to work on the relationship?"**

This is extremely common in the early stages. The betrayed partner may be too hurt to consider reconciliation, while the unfaithful partner desperately wants to save the relationship—or vice versa.

You don't need to be on the same page to start therapy. You just need to be willing to explore what's possible. Many couples use therapy to gain clarity about whether to stay together. This is a valid and important use of our time.

Individual therapy can also be valuable if your partner isn't ready. You can work on your own healing, understand your patterns, and prepare for whatever decision you ultimately make.

---

### About the Process

**"Do you see individuals or just couples?"**

Both. While couples therapy is the primary format for affair recovery, individual sessions are often necessary and beneficial. Sometimes we'll split sessions (25 minutes each), and sometimes we'll schedule separate individual sessions.

Individual therapy might focus on:
- Processing trauma (for the betrayed partner)
- Addressing shame and understanding root causes (for the unfaithful partner)
- Managing individual mental health concerns
- Preparing for difficult disclosures
- Working through ambivalence about the relationship

---

**"What if we're not sure about staying together?"**

That's completely normal and absolutely okay. You don't need to know whether you're staying together to benefit from therapy. In fact, trying to make that decision too quickly often creates more problems.

Therapy can help you:
- Process the immediate trauma
- Understand what happened and why
- Learn what would be required to rebuild
- Make a decision from a place of clarity rather than reaction
- Prepare for either reconciliation or conscious separation

Many couples find that removing the pressure to decide actually creates space for healing to begin.

---

**"What's the difference between affair recovery therapy and regular couples therapy?"**

Affair recovery requires specialized approaches that general couples therapy doesn't provide. Key differences include:

**Structured Protocols:** We follow proven, research-based phases specifically designed for betrayal recovery, not general relationship improvement.

**Trauma-Informed Approach:** We understand and treat the neurobiological impact of betrayal trauma, not just relationship dynamics.

**Different Rules:** Normal couples therapy assumes good faith between partners. After betrayal, we need different frameworks for safety and accountability.

**Specific Tools:** From disclosure protocols to trust-rebuilding exercises, we use interventions designed specifically for infidelity recovery.

**Appropriate Pacing:** We know when to slow down for safety and when to push for accountability—crucial for betrayal recovery.

---

### Practical Concerns

**"Is this covered by insurance?"**

Many insurance plans cover couples therapy, especially when there's a diagnosed condition like adjustment disorder or depression related to the relationship crisis. I'm in-network with:
- Blue Shield of California
- Anthem Blue Cross
- Cigna
- Aetna (select plans)

Call your insurance provider and ask about your outpatient mental health benefits for couples therapy (CPT code 90847). I can provide documentation for out-of-network reimbursement if your plan offers it.

---

**"What if we can't afford therapy?"**

I understand that investing in therapy during a crisis can feel overwhelming. Options include:

- Using insurance benefits
- HSA/FSA funds (therapy is a qualified medical expense)
- Payment plans for those who qualify
- Sliding scale spots (limited availability)
- Less frequent sessions once stabilized
- Supplementing with books and online resources I recommend

Remember: divorce costs an average of $15,000-30,000, not counting emotional costs. Therapy is an investment in either saving your relationship or ending it well.

---

**"How do I know if you're the right therapist for us?"**

The therapeutic relationship is crucial for success. During your consultation, consider:

- Do you feel heard and understood?
- Do I seem knowledgeable about your specific situation?
- Can you imagine being honest with me, even about difficult things?
- Do you feel hope (even a small amount) after talking with me?
- Does my approach make sense to you?

If I'm not the right fit, I'll provide referrals to other qualified specialists. The most important thing is that you get help from someone trained in affair recovery.

---

**"What if the affair partner won't end contact?"**

This is a non-negotiable for recovery. The affair must be completely over—no contact whatsoever except when absolutely unavoidable (co-parenting, necessary work interaction with strict boundaries).

If the unfaithful partner isn't willing to end all contact, we'll work on:
- Understanding what's preventing this essential step
- Individual therapy for the unfaithful partner to gain clarity
- Support for the betrayed partner in setting boundaries
- Preparation for potential separation if needed

Recovery cannot begin while the affair continues in any form.

---

### Getting Started

**"What's the first step?"**

Schedule a consultation. This 30-minute conversation will help us determine if we're a good fit and discuss next steps. There's no obligation to continue if it doesn't feel right.

**"How do I convince my partner to come to therapy?"**

You can't force someone into therapy, but you can:
- Share this website
- Express your needs without ultimatums
- Start individual therapy yourself
- Suggest just one consultation to explore options
- Focus on pain relief rather than relationship decisions

Sometimes seeing your commitment to healing motivates a reluctant partner to participate.

---

**Still Have Questions?**

Every situation is unique, and you may have concerns not addressed here. That's what the consultation is for—a chance to discuss your specific situation without commitment.
