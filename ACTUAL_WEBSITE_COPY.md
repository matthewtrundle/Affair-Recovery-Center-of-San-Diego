### FAQ Preview Section

**Section Title:** "Common Questions"
**Subtitle:** "You probably have many questions right now. Here are some I hear most often."

**FAQ 1:**
- Q: "Can a relationship really recover from an affair?"
- A: "Yes. While not every relationship survives infidelity, many couples not only recover but build stronger, more intimate relationships than they had before. The key is both partners being willing to do the work."

**FAQ 2:**
- Q: "How long does recovery typically take?"
- A: "Every couple is different, but most see significant progress within 3-6 months of consistent therapy. Full recovery and rebuilding typically takes 12-24 months. The timeline depends on many factors including the nature of the betrayal and both partners' commitment."

**FAQ 3:**
- Q: "What if my partner isn't ready for therapy?"
- A: "It's common for partners to be at different stages of readiness. I often work with individuals first to help them process their emotions and prepare for couples work. Sometimes seeing your own growth can inspire your partner to join."

**FAQ 4:**
- Q: "Do you take insurance?"
- A: "I am an out-of-network provider. I can provide superbills for potential insurance reimbursement. Many clients find that investing directly in their relationship recovery is worth the cost, and I offer flexible scheduling to maximize our time together."

**Bio Content:**
- "Since 2008, I've had one focus: affair recovery. Not general couples therapy, not 'communication issues' — the real, gut-wrenching work of rebuilding after betrayal. Whether you're a Navy family dealing with deployment infidelity or tech professionals navigating a workplace affair, I've seen your story. And I know how it can end well."
- "I use what works: Gottman Method (the science stuff) plus Relational Life Therapy (the 'let's get real' stuff). No fluff, no endless talking in circles. We'll deal with the crisis first, then figure out how you got here — without the blame game."
- "Here's what I know after 15 years in San Diego: You can get through this. I've seen couples go from sleeping in separate rooms in their Encinitas home to renewing vows at Sunset Cliffs. It's not easy, but it's possible. And I'll be straight with you every step of the way."

**Philosophy Points:**

**Healing is Always Possible:**
- "No matter how deep the betrayal, I've seen couples rebuild trust and create something beautiful from the ashes. Your relationship's future isn't determined by its past."

**Safety First, Always:**
- "Both partners need to feel emotionally and physically safe to do this work. Creating that safety is our first priority, and it's non-negotiable."

**Growth Through Understanding:**
- "Affairs don't happen in a vacuum. Understanding the 'why' isn't about blame—it's about preventing future betrayals and building resilience."

**Both Partners Matter:**
- "Whether you're the hurt partner or the partner who had the affair, your feelings and needs are valid. Healing requires both perspectives."

**Healing Takes Time:**
- "There's no rushing this process. I'll meet you where you are and move at the pace that feels right for your unique situation."

**You Are Stronger Than You Know:**
- "The courage to seek help, to face this pain, to work toward healing—that takes tremendous strength. I see that strength in every couple I work with."

### FAQ Section

**Section Title:** "Frequently Asked Questions"
**Subtitle:** "Common questions about our services and approach"

**FAQ Questions & Answers:**

1. Q: "How long does betrayal recovery therapy typically take?"
   A: "Most couples benefit from 12-20 sessions over 6-12 months, though every situation is unique. Initial stabilization usually takes 4-6 sessions, followed by deeper work on understanding and rebuilding. Some couples benefit from ongoing maintenance sessions after completing intensive work."

2. Q: "Do both partners need to be committed to the process?"
   A: "Yes, successful betrayal recovery requires commitment from both partners, though their readiness levels may differ initially. If only one partner is willing to work, I offer discernment counseling to help you explore your options and make informed decisions about your relationship's future."

3. Q: "What if we're not sure we want to stay together?"
   A: "That's completely normal and understandable. Discernment counseling can help you gain clarity before committing to full recovery work. This short-term counseling (1-5 sessions) helps you understand your options: status quo, separation/divorce, or committing to six months of intensive therapy."

4. Q: "How soon can we start therapy after discovery?"
   A: "The sooner, the better. While emotions are intense immediately after discovery, early intervention can prevent additional trauma and destructive patterns from taking hold. I specialize in crisis stabilization and can help you navigate this critical period safely."

5. Q: "Will individual therapy be necessary alongside couples work?"
   A: "Often, yes. Individual sessions help process trauma, work on personal issues that contributed to the crisis, and develop coping skills. I coordinate individual and couples work to ensure they support rather than conflict with each other. Many clients benefit from both modalities."

6. Q: "What insurance do you accept?"
   A: "I accept select insurance plans and provide superbills for out-of-network reimbursement. Many insurance plans cover therapy for relationship issues when there's a mental health component. I'm happy to discuss payment options and help you understand your benefits during our consultation."

**Subtitle:** "I've compiled answers to the most common questions I receive about affair recovery, the therapy process, and practical considerations. Use the search and filters to find exactly what you're looking for."

### Category: About Therapy Process

**Q: What if my partner isn't ready for couples therapy?**
A: "Super common, especially here in SD where everyone's schedule is packed. Maybe they're deployed, maybe they're in denial, maybe they're scared. I get it. I can work with just you first — help you figure out your next move, deal with the rage/panic, get you stable. Sometimes when one partner starts healing, the other comes around. My Carmel Valley office is easy to get to from anywhere — right off the 5."

**Q: What happens in a typical session?**
A: "We meet for 60 minutes (75 for the first one). No lying on couches — we sit and talk like normal people. Early on, it's about stopping the bleeding and making sure nobody's about to do something they'll regret. I use proven methods, not woo-woo stuff. You'll both get to talk (no, one person doesn't dominate). And yes, there's homework, but it's stuff you can do while walking at Torrey Pines or over coffee in North Park."

**Q: Do you see partners individually as well as together?**
A: "Yep, I mix it up. Sometimes you need to vent without your partner there — totally get it. I might see you both together, then each alone, then back together. Individual sessions are great for the 'I can't say this in front of them yet' stuff. Especially helpful for military families where deployment trauma might be mixed in, or when someone's dealing with work stress from their biotech job on top of the affair."

**Q: Is what we discuss in therapy really confidential?**
A: "100%. Your business stays your business. I follow all the legal stuff (HIPAA, etc.). The only time I'd have to speak up is if someone's in danger. For couples: I have a 'no secrets' rule — if you tell me something huge in an individual session that affects your relationship, we'll need to find a way to share it. But I'm not gossiping about you at Lestats or anywhere else. What happens in my office stays there."

**Q: How do you handle explosive emotions during sessions?**
A: "I've seen it all — crying, yelling, the silent treatment. It's normal when your world's been turned upside down. If things get too heated, we take a break. Maybe look at the ocean view from my window, do some breathing. I'll teach you how to calm your nervous system (useful for those anxiety attacks in the Vons parking lot too). My job is keeping things productive, not letting it turn into a boxing match."

**Q: What makes your approach different from other therapists?**
A: "I only do affair recovery. That's it. Not depression, not general couples stuff — just helping people recover from betrayal. Been doing it in San Diego since 2008. I know the unique pressures here: military deployments, biotech work culture, the whole 'perfect SoCal life' pressure. I'm direct (won't waste your time) but not harsh. And I actually give you tools that work, not just 'how does that make you feel?' for months on end."

### Category: Affair Recovery Specific

**Q: Can a relationship really recover from an affair?**
A: "Absolutely. I've seen San Diego couples go from 'it's over' to stronger than ever. From military couples dealing with deployment affairs to Sorrento Valley tech workers navigating workplace betrayals — recovery is real. It takes both people showing up, the person who cheated owning it completely, and having someone who knows what they're doing guide you through. Not gonna lie, it's hard work. But I've been doing this since 2008, and I've seen it happen hundreds of times."

**Q: How long does affair recovery typically take?**
A: "Real talk? You'll feel less crazy in about 3-6 months. Actually trusting again? That's more like 12-18 months of solid work. Depends on stuff like: Was it a one-night thing in Vegas or a year-long situation? Did they confess or did you catch them? Are you both really in this? Military deployments and high-pressure jobs (looking at you, biotech) can add time. You'll have good days and days where you're crying in the Trader Joe's parking lot. That's normal."

**Q: What are the stages of affair recovery?**
A: "Affair recovery typically moves through three main phases: 1) Crisis/Stabilization (managing initial shock, establishing safety, containing damage), 2) Understanding/Processing (exploring what led to the affair, processing emotions, beginning to rebuild communication), and 3) Integration/Rebuilding (creating a new relationship, rebuilding trust, developing deeper intimacy). Each phase has its own challenges and milestones."
