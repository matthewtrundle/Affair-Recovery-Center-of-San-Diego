## APPROACH PAGE

### Hero Section
**Headline:** My Therapeutic Approach
**Subheadline:** Evidence-based methods combined with real compassion

### The Gottman Method
**Overview:**
The Gottman Method is based on 40+ years of research with thousands of couples. For affair recovery, I use the specialized Trust Revival Method, which provides a roadmap for rebuilding after betrayal.

**Key Components:**
- **Atone:** The unfaithful partner takes full responsibility
- **Attune:** Both partners learn to tune into each other's needs
- **Attach:** Rebuild secure emotional and physical connection

**Why It Works:**
Research shows that 70% of couples using Gottman Method for affair recovery report relationship satisfaction two years post-treatment.

### Relational Life Therapy
**Overview:**
Developed by Terry Real, RLT is a direct, no-nonsense approach that cuts through traditional therapy limitations. It's about getting real, getting accountable, and getting results.

**Core Principles:**
- Radical accountability over blame
- Intimacy through truth-telling
- Breaking toxic patterns
- Creating a culture of appreciation
- Moving from complaint to request

**Why I Love RLT:**
It doesn't coddle or enable. It challenges both partners to show up fully and create the relationship they actually want, not settle for mediocrity.

### Integrated Neuroscience
**The Brain on Betrayal:**
Discovering an affair triggers the same brain regions as physical pain. Your nervous system goes into survival mode, making rational conversation nearly impossible.

**What We'll Do:**
- Understand your trauma responses
- Learn regulation techniques
- Develop window of tolerance
- Create new neural pathways
- Build resilience practices

## FAQ PAGE

### About Therapy Process

**What if my partner isn't ready for couples therapy?**
Super common, especially here in SD where everyone's schedule is packed. Maybe they're deployed, maybe they're in denial, maybe they're scared. I get it. I can work with just you first — help you figure out your next move, deal with the rage/panic, get you stable. Sometimes when one partner starts healing, the other comes around. My Carmel Valley office is easy to get to from anywhere — right off the 5.

**What happens in a typical session?**
We meet for 60 minutes (75 for the first one). No lying on couches — we sit and talk like normal people. Early on, it's about stopping the bleeding and making sure nobody's about to do something they'll regret. I use proven methods, not woo-woo stuff. You'll both get to talk (no, one person doesn't dominate). And yes, there's homework, but it's stuff you can do while walking at Torrey Pines or over coffee in North Park.

**Do you see partners individually as well as together?**
Yep, I mix it up. Sometimes you need to vent without your partner there — totally get it. I might see you both together, then each alone, then back together. Individual sessions are great for the "I can't say this in front of them yet" stuff. Especially helpful for military families where deployment trauma might be mixed in, or when someone's dealing with work stress from their biotech job on top of the affair.

**Is what we discuss in therapy really confidential?**
100%. Your business stays your business. I follow all the legal stuff (HIPAA, etc.). The only time I'd have to speak up is if someone's in danger. For couples: I have a "no secrets" rule — if you tell me something huge in an individual session that affects your relationship, we'll need to find a way to share it. But I'm not gossiping about you at Lestats or anywhere else. What happens in my office stays there.

**How do you handle explosive emotions during sessions?**
I've seen it all — crying, yelling, the silent treatment. It's normal when your world's been turned upside down. If things get too heated, we take a break. Maybe look at the ocean view from my window, do some breathing. I'll teach you how to calm your nervous system (useful for those anxiety attacks in the Vons parking lot too). My job is keeping things productive, not letting it turn into a boxing match.

### About Recovery & Healing

**Can we really recover from an affair?**
Yes, but not all relationships should. About 60% of couples who commit to therapy after infidelity create stronger relationships than before. The other 40%? They figure out how to separate with dignity. Either way, you'll have clarity. Recovery takes serious work — think marathon training, not a casual jog. But if both partners are committed, I've seen beautiful transformations. Some couples tell me the affair was the wake-up call that saved their marriage.

**How long does affair recovery typically take?**
Real talk: 1-2 years for most couples. Not what you want to hear, I know. The acute crisis phase? 3-6 months. Building real trust again? 6-12 months. Creating a new relationship? That's the rest. Some couples need 6 months, some need 3 years. Depends on the type of affair, how long it lasted, and how much work you're willing to do. Military couples with deployment issues might need longer. High-achieving couples who throw themselves into the work sometimes move faster.

**What's your success rate?**
I don't BS people with made-up numbers. "Success" means different things. Some couples rebuild beautifully. Others realize separation is healthiest. Both can be successes. What I can promise: if you do the work, you'll get clarity. You'll understand what happened and why. You'll know if this relationship can be saved. And if it can't, you'll know you tried everything.

### About Betrayal & Affairs

**How do you not take sides?**
I'm not Team Betrayed or Team Unfaithful — I'm Team Truth. The betrayed partner needs their pain witnessed. The unfaithful partner needs to understand the destruction they caused. But villain/victim dynamics keep you stuck. We're going for understanding, not winning. I'll call out both of you when needed. The betrayed partner's rage matters. So does the unfaithful partner's story. Both are true.

**Do you believe "once a cheater, always a cheater"?**
Nope. That's fear talking, not facts. People who do the work to understand why they cheated — really understand, not just feel bad — rarely repeat. But "I don't know why I did it" or "It just happened"? Red flags. In therapy, we dig deep into the why. When people face their demons and change their patterns, transformation is real.

**How do we handle triggers during recovery?**
Triggers are normal and expected after betrayal. I'll teach you both how to recognize early warning signs, use grounding techniques, and communicate about triggers without shame. The unfaithful partner learns how to respond supportively rather than defensively. We'll create safety plans and coping strategies. Over time, triggers become less frequent and intense as healing progresses.

### Practical Concerns

**How much does therapy cost?**
$350 per 60-minute session, $450 for the initial 90-minute assessment. Yes, it's an investment. Think of it this way: divorce in San Diego averages $15,000-$30,000, not counting emotional costs. Therapy is a fraction of that. I don't take insurance directly, but I'll give you documentation for reimbursement if you have out-of-network benefits. HSA/FSA cards work great.

**What's your cancellation policy?**
I require 24-hour notice for cancellations or you'll be charged for the session. I understand that crises happen, and I'll work with you on genuine emergencies. Frequent cancellations can disrupt the therapeutic process, so we'll discuss any patterns that arise. Rescheduling is usually possible with adequate notice.

**Where exactly is your office?**
I'm in Carmel Valley, right off the 5 near the 56 merge. Easy from North County, convenient from downtown, doable from East County. Free parking, private entrance, no awkward waiting room encounters. The office has ocean views on clear days — sometimes just looking out helps calm the nervous system. I picked this location because it's accessible but private.

**Do you offer virtual sessions?**
Yes, especially for established clients. Sometimes it's easier to squeeze in a session during lunch from your Sorrento Valley office or while the kids are at school. Video sessions work well for individual sessions or when someone's traveling. For intense couples work, in-person is usually better. During deployments, we absolutely use video to maintain continuity.

**Can you prescribe medication?**
I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist, so no prescriptions. But anxiety and depression often spike after betrayal. I work with several excellent psychiatrists in San Diego who understand affair trauma. If medication might help, I'll connect you with someone who gets it. Sometimes a little pharmaceutical support makes therapy more effective.

### About Me & My Approach

**Why do you specialize in affair recovery?**
Because I've seen how the right help changes everything. Early in my career, I watched couples struggle through infidelity with therapists who didn't know how to help. Generic "communication exercises" don't cut it when someone's world has exploded. I invested in specialized training because San Diego couples deserve an expert, not someone winging it. This work matters too much to half-ass it.
