Create a cinematic 10-second video for a premier couples therapy practice in San Diego specializing in affair recovery and betrayal trauma.

OPENING SHOT (0-3 seconds):
Aerial establishing shot descending toward La Jolla Cove at golden hour. The camera slowly reveals a couple in their 40s standing at the cliff's edge, looking out at the Pacific. They stand close but not touching - a visual metaphor for connection despite distance. Professional wardrobe: he wears a navy cashmere sweater, she in cream linen. The shot conveys contemplation, not despair.

TRANSITION (3-5 seconds):
Smooth dolly shot along Torrey Pines State Reserve trail. The couple walks a winding path, now holding hands. Dappled sunlight through the pines creates organic lighting patterns. Their body language shows tentative reconnection - professional actors conveying subtle emotional nuance. No forced smiles, but genuine presence.

INTERIOR SCENE (5-8 seconds):
Cut to elegant therapy office with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the Pacific. Warm walnut furniture, original coastal artwork, leather-bound books. The couple sits in modern chairs across from the therapist - a composed professional presence. Natural conversation gestures, active listening postures. Gottman Institute materials subtly visible. The space exudes expertise and sanctuary.

CLOSING FRAME (8-10 seconds):
Return to exterior - sunset silhouette shot from Windansea Beach. The couple faces each other, hands joined, waves gently breaking behind them. Camera pulls back slowly to reveal the expansive coastline. The frame holds for seamless loop back to opening aerial.

VISUAL LANGUAGE:
Cinematography inspired by Terrence Malick - natural light, fluid camera movements, intimate yet respectful distance. Color grading evokes the warmth of Nancy Meyers films - sophisticated, aspirational, healing. Not clinical, not casual - the visual equivalent of a New Yorker article about modern relationships.

COLOR STORY:
Deep ocean navy (#0C1B2A), warm cashmere gray (#6B7280), ivory sand (#FDF4E3), muted sage (#8B9A88), subtle coral (#E8B4A6). Professional healthcare marketing meets Architectural Digest coastal home feature.

TYPOGRAPHY TREATMENT:
Primary text: "When trust has been broken, healing requires expertise."
Appears at 2 seconds, elegant fade, Didot or Bodoni font, positioned lower left third.

Secondary text: "Evidence-based therapy for affair recovery"
Subtle appearance at 5 seconds, Helvetica Neue Light, smaller scale.

Call to action: "Begin your recovery journey"
Soft fade-in at 8 seconds, understated placement.

No rotating gimmicks or trendy effects. Clean, sophisticated, professional.

AUDIO LANDSCAPE:
Ambient ocean sounds mixed at -24db. No music initially - add subtle string quartet in post if needed (think Max Richter, not meditation app). Natural room tone in office scene. No dialogue, but authentic conversation murmur.

PRODUCTION NOTES:
This is not a beach vacation commercial. This is sophisticated healthcare marketing for discerning clients who expect excellence. Think of the visual tone of a Cedars-Sinai campaign or Mayo Clinic spot - professional, warm, but never casual. The San Diego setting should feel incidental, not touristy.

Cast diverse professional actors aged 38-45. No models - real faces with character and depth. Wardrobe by Eileen Fisher or COS - understated elegance.

The office must feel like where a Fortune 500 executive would seek help - not a strip mall counseling center. Fresh white orchids, current New Yorker on the side table, original art, natural materials.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- 10-second duration, perfect loop point
- 4K acquisition, deliver in 4K and 1080p
- 24fps for cinematic motion
- Aspect ratios: 16:9 primary, 9:16 and 1:1 for social
- Professional color grade by a DI colorist
- No stock footage - everything originally shot

EMOTIONAL INTENT:
This video should make viewers feel that recovery is not only possible but can lead to profound growth. It should convey expertise without arrogance, warmth without casualness, hope without false promises. When someone watches this, they should think: "These are the experts who can help us through this crisis."

The overall impression: A practice where Stanford professors and Qualcomm executives would feel comfortable being vulnerable. Where expertise meets empathy. Where San Diego's natural beauty provides a backdrop for healing, not a distraction from the serious work of rebuilding trust.
