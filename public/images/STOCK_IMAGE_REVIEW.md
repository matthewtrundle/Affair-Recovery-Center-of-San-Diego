## Replacement Guidelines

### Photography Requirements

**Must-Have Characteristics**:
1. **Age Range**: 30-50 years old (prime demographic for affair recovery)
2. **Diversity**: Varied ethnicities, body types (avoid only thin/young/white couples)
3. **Clothing**: Casual, everyday wear (jeans, sweaters, simple tops - NO matching outfits)
4. **Settings**: 
   - San Diego beaches (La Jolla, Torrey Pines, Coronado, Windansea)
   - Indoor therapy spaces (warm, professional, not overly styled)
   - Neutral outdoor locations (parks, gardens)
5. **Lighting**: Natural, soft (overcast days ideal), avoid dramatic golden hour
6. **Poses**: 
   - Side-by-side walking
   - Sitting together (talking, holding hands)
   - Gentle embraces (not passionate/romantic)
   - Eye contact between couple (not just camera)
7. **Emotion**: Hope, connection, vulnerability, comfort (not perfection or passion)

**Avoid**:
- Silhouettes (overused, lacks humanity)
- Matching/coordinated outfits (screams photoshoot)
- Dramatic lighting (sunset extremes, studio perfection)
- Wedding/engagement aesthetics
- Risky/dangerous locations
- Obvious model poses
- Overly young couples (<30)
- Only one type of couple (diversity matters)

## Sourcing Options

### Option 1: Custom Photography (RECOMMENDED)
**Pros**: Fully authentic, San Diego locations, perfect brand alignment  
**Cons**: Higher cost ($800-2,000 for session)  
**Approach**:
- Hire local San Diego photographer
- Recruit 2-3 real couples (friends, past clients with consent, volunteers)
- Shoot at 2-3 locations (beach, office, park)
- 2-hour session yields 20-30 usable images
- Ensure model releases for commercial use

### Option 2: Premium Stock (Careful Selection)
**Pros**: Immediate availability, professional quality  
**Cons**: Risk of generic look, used by competitors  
**Sources**:
- Shutterstock "Authentic Collection"
- Getty Images "Real People" category
- Adobe Stock (filter: "candid," "lifestyle")
**Budget**: $50-150 per image (standard license)

### Option 3: AI Generation with Extreme Care
**Pros**: Custom scenarios, full control  
**Cons**: Can look artificial, ethical concerns, disclosure requirements  
**If Used**:
- Midjourney v6 or DALL-E 3 with photorealistic prompts
- Heavy post-processing to reduce AI "sheen"
- Never use for hero images (only backgrounds/secondary)
- Disclose if required by platform policies

## Search Terms for Stock Photography

If using stock libraries, use these search combinations:

**Good Terms**:
- "mature couple therapy session"
- "real couples counseling authentic"
- "middle aged couple support comfort"
- "diverse couples connection trust"
- "couple talking serious conversation beach"
- "interracial couple support embrace"
- "40s couple holding hands walking"

**Avoid Terms**:
- "couple in love" (too romantic)
- "engagement" / "wedding" (wrong context)
- "happy couple" (betrayal trauma isn't about happiness yet)
- "silhouette" (overused)
- "dramatic sunset" (too stylized)

## Component Usage Audit

**Finding**: Direct grep searches did not find explicit imports of these specific couple images in TSX/TS files. This suggests:

1. Images may be **orphaned assets** (no longer in use) - safe to replace
2. Images may be loaded via **CMS or dynamic imports** not visible in static code
3. Images may be referenced by **different filenames** in import statements

**Action Required**: Manual verification by searching the running site for these images, or check Payload CMS media library to see which images are actively used in content.

**Images to Verify**:
- `sections/feature-couple-beach.webp` (HIGH PRIORITY)
- `sections/hero-couple-portrait.webp` (HIGH PRIORITY)
- `sections/couple-hero-healing.webp` (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- `beach/sunset-cliffs-silhouette.webp` (HIGH PRIORITY)
- `beach/windansea-couple-walk.webp` (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Images Confirmed via Context**:
- `couples/beach-conversation.webp` - KEEP (authentic looking)
- `couples/neural-healing-abstract.webp` - KEEP (abstract art)
