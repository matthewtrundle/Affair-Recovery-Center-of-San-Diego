Create a professional 10-second seamless loop video for a couples therapy practice specializing in affair recovery in San Diego.

SCENE PROGRESSION:
0-3 seconds: Wide establishing shot of La Jolla Shores at golden hour. A diverse couple in their 40s walks hand-in-hand along the water's edge, small in frame. Camera dollies parallel, maintaining respectful distance.

3-5 seconds: Medium tracking shot following the couple walking, gentle waves lapping at their feet. Soft golden hour lighting, no dramatic shadows.

5-7 seconds: Smooth transition to warm therapist office interior. Professional space with ocean view through windows, bookshelves with Gottman materials visible, certificates on walls, warm wood tones.

7-10 seconds: Medium shot of couple sitting in consultation with therapist. Natural conversation gestures, hopeful body language, therapist actively listening. Professional but warm atmosphere.
